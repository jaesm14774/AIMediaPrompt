## Prompt Template

A 5-second gradual transformation video sequence in vibrant Nintendo game animation style with cartoon cel-shading rendering. **[物體 / "a single water droplet falling in slow motion" / "raindrops falling during a gentle shower" / "a puddle rippling from footsteps" / "soap bubbles floating in sunlight"]** slowly reveals Kirby's iconic features through a detailed step-by-step metamorphosis.

**Opening (0-1s)**: Close-up shot of the ordinary object in its natural state, [場景環境 with: 自然光線 / "backlit by soft morning sunlight with bokeh background" / "under grey rainy sky with atmospheric mist" / "in urban street setting with reflective surfaces" / "against pastel sky with dreamy clouds"], crystal clear details, photorealistic liquid physics, 4K resolution. The object appears completely normal with no hint of transformation yet.

**Color Shift Beginning (1-2s)**: A single tiny spot of bubblegum pink (#FFB3D9) appears on the object's surface, like a watercolor drop spreading slowly. The pink hue gradually expands from this point, creating a gentle gradient as it spreads across the object. Delicate sparkles trace along the edge of the expanding pink area. The transformation is subtle and organic, maintaining the object's original shape and texture while slowly tinting it pink. Camera begins a slow push-in focusing on the color transition.

**Feature Emergence (2-3s)**: As the pink color fully saturates the object, the first hints of facial features begin to appear. Two faint oval shadows emerge where Kirby's eyes will be - barely visible at first, like watermarks appearing on paper. The shadows slowly darken and take shape, revealing the characteristic large oval eyes with subtle blue irises forming in the center. Simultaneously, on what will become the cheeks, two delicate teardrop-shaped marks start to materialize in a slightly deeper pink shade, oriented pointing toward where the eyes are forming. The object's surface starts to subtly shift from realistic texture to smooth cartoon rendering. Gentle glow particles float around, soft focus adjusts to emphasize the emerging features.

**Shape Transformation (3-4s)**: The object's form begins to morph and round out, edges softening into Kirby's perfect spherical shape. The eyes are now fully defined - large black ovals with distinctive white crescent-shaped glints and blue irises clearly visible, giving that signature innocent Kirby expression. The teardrop blush marks are now prominent and vibrant. A tiny curved line appears forming Kirby's small smiling mouth. Below the sphere, small rounded nubs start to protrude and extend, gradually forming into Kirby's characteristic stubby arms and oval feet. The transformation maintains a fluid, organic pace - nothing pops into existence suddenly, everything flows and morphs smoothly. Soft star-shaped sparkles drift around the transforming form.

**Final Form (4-5s)**: Now fully transformed into complete Kirby, the character gives a gentle bounce with Nintendo's signature animation style - slight squash and stretch on landing. Kirby rotates slightly to show the full spherical design from multiple angles. All features are perfectly rendered: bubblegum pink smooth surface, large expressive oval eyes with white shine, prominent teardrop-shaped blush marks on both cheeks, tiny smile, stubby rounded arms and feet. Soft rim lighting highlights the curves of the spherical body. Remaining sparkles settle and fade. Kirby strikes a cute ending pose with slight head tilt, eyes wide and cheerful. Background slightly defocused with warm pastel color palette creating a dreamy atmosphere.

**Technical specs**: 60fps smooth motion, 4K resolution, motion blur on fast movements, vibrant color grading with high saturation, bright and cheerful lighting. Cartoon rendering with soft shadows, no harsh edges. Upbeat whimsical music suggestion: light piano with chime accents.

**Visual consistency**: Maintain Kirby's core features throughout - bubblegum pink color (#FFB3D9), perfectly round spherical body, large oval black eyes with white shine, teardrop-shaped pink blush marks pointing toward eyes, stubby rounded limbs.

## Example

A 5-second gradual transformation video sequence in vibrant Nintendo game animation style with cartoon cel-shading rendering. A single water droplet falling in slow motion slowly reveals Kirby's iconic features through a detailed step-by-step metamorphosis.

**Opening (0-1s)**: Close-up shot of the ordinary water droplet in its natural state, backlit by soft morning sunlight with bokeh background, crystal clear details, photorealistic liquid physics, 4K resolution. The droplet appears completely normal with no hint of transformation yet.

**Color Shift Beginning (1-2s)**: A single tiny spot of bubblegum pink (#FFB3D9) appears on the droplet's surface, like a watercolor drop spreading slowly. The pink hue gradually expands from this point, creating a gentle gradient as it spreads across the droplet. Delicate sparkles trace along the edge of the expanding pink area. The transformation is subtle and organic, maintaining the droplet's original shape and texture while slowly tinting it pink. Camera begins a slow push-in focusing on the color transition.
