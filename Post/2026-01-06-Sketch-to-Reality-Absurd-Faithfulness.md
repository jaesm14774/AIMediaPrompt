A split-screen 5-second video showcasing "Sketch-to-Reality" transformation. **Upper-left corner** (占畫面15%): A childlike crayon sketch on crumpled white paper, taped to wall with scotch tape, showing [塗鴉物體 with: "round-ball chicken with two stick legs" / "rectangular car with tiny wheels" / "human figure with giant head (3x body size) and noodle arms" / "triangle fish with dot eyes and line fins"], drawn with crude black marker lines, intentionally distorted proportions, kindergarten-level art quality. **Main frame** (占畫面85%): Photorealistic 3D render of the sketch brought to life in [場景環境 with: "suburban neighborhood street with real houses and parked cars" / "grassy meadow with wildflowers and natural sunlight" / "urban plaza with pedestrians and storefronts" / "sandy beach with ocean waves and seagulls"].

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR AI**: **Preserve exact proportions from sketch. Do NOT fix anatomy. Do NOT correct distortions. Faithfully render the impossible geometry with hyperrealistic materials.** The deformed object moves with [動作類型 with: "waddling walk (for creatures) - legs bend despite wrong proportions" / "rolling/driving motion (for vehicles) - wheels spin, body wobbles" / "swimming/flying (for animals) - wings/fins flap awkwardly but physically" / "walking and arm-swinging (for humanoids) - joints bend at wrong angles"].

**Timing Breakdown:**

- **0-1s**: Establishing dual view - sketch appears static in corner (gentle paper texture visible, tape shadows, slight curl at edges). Main frame starts with empty environment. Camera at eye level, natural lighting (soft overcast daylight, 5500K color temperature). At 0.7s, the deformed object fades into existence in main frame (opacity 0% → 100% over 0.3s), positioned center-left. Object's materials are hyperrealistic: [材質細節 with: "feathers with individual barbs, skin pores, glossy eyes (for creatures)" / "metallic car paint with reflections, rubber tire texture, chrome details (for vehicles)" / "realistic skin with subsurface scattering, fabric clothing wrinkles, hair strands (for humanoids)"]. Initial pose matches sketch exactly - distorted proportions clearly visible.

- **1-3s**: Active motion sequence - object begins moving across frame from left to right. **Physics simulation paradox**: Despite impossible geometry, motion follows real-world physics (gravity, inertia, ground contact). Camera slow pans right (tracking shot at 5cm/s) keeping object in frame. If creature: legs animate in walking cycle but proportions remain wrong (stick legs support round-ball body, creating comedic waddle). If vehicle: wheels rotate, suspension bounces on uneven ground, exhaust emits realistic smoke despite rectangular body. If humanoid: arms swing, head bobbles on tiny neck, shadow accurately reflects distorted silhouette. Background environment shows depth - shallow depth of field (f/2.8) with bokeh on distant elements. Lighting creates realistic shadows beneath deformed object. At 2.0s, camera zooms in 10% closer for detail emphasis.

- **3-4s**: Peak absurdity showcase - **extreme close-up on most distorted feature** (0.5 second moment). If creature: zoom to stick legs struggling to support ball body, muscles and tendons render realistically despite wrong anatomy. If vehicle: zoom to tiny wheels bearing impossible weight, tire rubber deforming realistically. If humanoid: zoom to giant head bobbing, skin texture and pores visible, eyes blinking naturally. Camera shake (subtle, 2-3px amplitude) adds handheld documentary realism. Environmental interaction: dust kicks up from footsteps, grass bends under weight, ground shows contact shadows. Volumetric lighting (god rays if outdoor, atmospheric haze if urban) enhances photorealism.

- **4-5s**: Reveal and loop setup - camera pulls back to medium-wide shot showing full deformed object in environment. Object continues motion toward right edge of frame. At 4.3s, quick visual comparison moment: **split-second cut** inserts sketch in corner with glow/highlight (0.2s duration) reminding viewers "this absurd shape is real now." Final motion: object exits frame right OR turns to face camera (comedic acknowledgment). Lighting reaches peak quality - golden hour warm glow (if outdoor) or commercial-grade studio lighting (if indoor). Background crowd/vehicles/animals react naturally (pedestrians do double-takes, birds fly away startled). Fade to 90% opacity at 4.9s preparing for potential loop. Final frame freezes briefly (0.1s) as perfect shareable moment.

**Technical Specifications:**
- Resolution: 4K (3840x2160), 60fps for smooth motion and physics simulation
- Aspect Ratio: 16:9 (landscape) or 9:16 (vertical for social media)
- Sketch Overlay: Static image in upper-left, 15% screen space, subtle paper texture, realistic tape shadows
- Rendering Engine: Unreal Engine 5 / Octane Render quality - ray-traced lighting, global illumination, realistic material shaders
- Camera: Handheld-style smooth tracking (gimbal stabilization with 2% shake for realism), 50mm equivalent focal length
- Depth of Field: f/2.8 shallow focus - object sharp, background softly blurred (bokeh)
- Lighting: Natural outdoor (HDRI environment map, sun position at 45° angle) OR studio three-point lighting (key 5000K, rim 6500K, fill 4500K)
- Color Grading: Slightly desaturated realism (not hyper-vibrant), film grain (subtle, 2% intensity), warm tint (+5 kelvin)
- Physics Simulation: Real-world gravity (9.8m/s²), accurate collision detection, soft-body dynamics for organic objects, rigid-body for vehicles
- Animation: Motion-captured or procedurally generated gait/movement, secondary motion (fabric sway, hair bounce, vehicle suspension)
- Sound Design: Realistic foley (footsteps on gravel, car engine hum, fabric rustling), environmental ambience (birds, wind, traffic), subtle comedic timing (cartoon-style sound effects optional for emphasis)
- Particle Effects: Dust clouds on footsteps, tire smoke, exhaust fumes, ambient floating particles (pollen, dust motes in light beams)

**Core Humor Mechanism:**
- **Contrast Maximization**: Crudest possible sketch × Highest possible render quality = Comedy gold
- **Uncanny Valley**: Photorealistic textures on impossible geometry creates discomfort + laughter
- **Serious Execution of Absurdity**: Treat the deformed object with documentary-level professionalism (National Geographic filming a round-ball chicken seriously)
- **Physics Paradox**: Object obeys real physics despite violating biological/engineering logic (stick legs actually supporting weight, tiny wheels actually rolling)

📝 **Example / 指令範例**

> 提供高質量、完整填寫的範例版本 - 球體雞在郊區街道蹣跚行走。

A split-screen 5-second video showcasing "Sketch-to-Reality" transformation. **Upper-left corner** (占畫面15%): A childlike crayon sketch on crumpled white paper, taped to wall with scotch tape, showing a **round-ball chicken with two stick legs** - body is a perfect circle (like beach ball), legs are straight vertical lines, tiny triangle beak, two dot eyes, drawn with crude black marker lines, intentionally distorted proportions, kindergarten-level art quality. **Main frame** (占畫面85%): Photorealistic 3D render of the sketch brought to life in a **suburban neighborhood street with real houses, parked cars, white picket fences, and green lawns**.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR AI**: **Preserve exact proportions from sketch. Do NOT fix anatomy. Do NOT correct distortions. Faithfully render the impossible geometry with hyperrealistic materials.** The deformed chicken moves with **waddling walk - stick legs bend despite supporting a massive spherical body, creating comedic struggle**.

**Timing Breakdown:**

- **0-1s**: Establishing dual view - sketch appears static in corner (gentle paper texture visible, scotch tape shadows, slight curl at edges). Main frame starts with empty suburban street (morning light, 8am atmosphere). Camera at eye level, natural overcast daylight (5500K). At 0.7s, the deformed chicken fades into existence (opacity 0% → 100% over 0.3s), positioned center-left on sidewalk. Chicken's materials are hyperrealistic: **white feathers with individual barbs and subtle sheen, orange scaly stick-legs with skin texture and wrinkles at joints, glossy black dot eyes with light reflections, yellow triangle beak with keratin texture**. Body is perfectly spherical (beach ball proportions) supported impossibly by two thin stick legs. Initial pose: standing still, legs slightly bent under weight.

- **1-3s**: Active waddle sequence - chicken begins walking across sidewalk from left to right. **Physics paradox**: Despite ball-shaped body and stick legs, motion follows real physics. Legs animate in awkward walking cycle - knees bend inward under weight, feet (tiny orange triangular feet) make contact with concrete, body wobbles side-to-side with each step creating pendulum motion. Camera slow pans right (tracking at 5cm/s). Feathers ruffle realistically with movement, subtle wind effect. Background houses show depth - shallow focus (f/2.8) with bokeh on distant trees. Realistic shadow of round body and stick legs moves beneath chicken. At 2.0s, camera zooms 10% closer showing feather detail and leg strain.

- **3-4s**: Peak absurdity showcase - **extreme close-up on stick legs** (0.5s): zoom reveals legs are anatomically chicken legs but impossibly thin (1cm diameter) supporting 50cm diameter ball body. Muscles, tendons, scales render hyperrealistically despite wrong proportions. Legs visibly strain and tremble under weight (subtle animation). Camera shake (2-3px) adds documentary feel. Dust kicks from tiny feet on concrete. Volumetric morning light (soft god rays through trees) catches feather edges. At 3.5s, zoom out to medium shot.

- **4-5s**: Reveal and comedic finish - camera pulls to medium-wide showing full round chicken waddling past white picket fence. Chicken continues toward right frame edge. At 4.3s, **sketch in corner glows briefly** (yellow highlight, 0.2s) reminding viewers of absurd source. At 4.6s, chicken stops, turns head toward camera (dot eyes blink once, cartoon-style), then continues waddling. Background: neighbor watering lawn does subtle double-take (realistic human reaction). Golden morning light (warm 6500K) from sun at 45° creates beautiful rim lighting on spherical body. Ambient sounds: birds chirping, distant lawnmower, chicken's tiny feet tapping concrete. Fade to 90% at 4.9s. Final freeze frame: chicken mid-waddle, one stick leg raised, perfect shareable moment.

**Technical Specifications:**
- Resolution: 4K (3840x2160), 60fps
- Aspect Ratio: 16:9 landscape
- Sketch Overlay: Static, upper-left 15%, paper texture, tape shadows
- Rendering: Unreal Engine 5 quality - ray tracing, global illumination, subsurface scattering on skin/feathers
- Camera: 50mm lens, handheld smooth tracking with 2% shake, f/2.8 shallow DoF
- Lighting: Morning overcast natural (HDRI map), sun at 45° for rim light
- Color Grading: Slightly desaturated, +5K warm tint, 2% film grain
- Physics: 9.8m/s² gravity, collision detection, soft-body feather dynamics
- Animation: Procedural walking gait with weight distribution struggle, secondary feather motion
- Sound: Tiny footsteps on concrete, feather rustling, ambient suburban morning sounds
- Particles: Dust puffs at footsteps, ambient pollen in sunbeams

**Core Humor**: Photorealistic chicken with beach-ball body on toothpick legs, rendered with AAA-game quality, moving with documentary seriousness despite biological impossibility.

💡 **Key Parameters / 關鍵參數解析**

- **"Preserve exact proportions. Do NOT fix anatomy."**: 這是核心指令！大多數AI會自動「修正」錯誤，但這個概念要求忠實保留扭曲比例，創造恐怖谷喜劇效果 (This CRITICAL instruction fights AI's natural tendency to "fix" errors—the distortions ARE the feature, not a bug! SEO gold: "uncanny valley comedy", "intentional distortion rendering")

- **Physics Simulation Paradox**: 物體遵循真實物理（重力、碰撞）但違反生物力學邏輯。球體身體用牙籤腿走路時，腿會真實「顫抖承重」 (Objects obey real-world physics despite impossible anatomy—this paradox is the comedic hook. Search trending: "physics paradox animation", "realistic motion impossible geometry")

- **Split-Screen 15%/85%**: 虛（塗鴉）佔15%，實（渲染）佔85%，創造強烈對比但不喧賓奪主 (Perfect ratio for visual contrast—sketch reminds viewers "this absurdity is intentional" without overwhelming the photorealistic render. Instagram algorithm loves split-screen formats!)

- **Unreal Engine 5 / Ray Tracing**: 用最頂級的渲染技術（光線追蹤、全域照明、次表面散射）渲染最荒謬的形狀 = 喜劇黃金 (Maximal contrast = maximal comedy. Using AAA game-quality rendering on kindergarten sketches creates viral-worthy cognitive dissonance. SEO: "Unreal Engine 5 comedy", "photorealistic absurd animation")

- **4.3s Sketch Glow**: 短暫閃回塗鴉並發光，強化「這真的是那張爛圖」的荒謬感 (This 0.2s callback is psychological genius—refreshes the absurdity just before the punchline, boosting shareability and watch-time for algorithm favor)

🎨 **Pro Tips / 專家建議**

❌ 讓AI自動「優化」比例，結果變成普通的可愛動畫，失去恐怖谷效果 (Letting AI "fix" proportions kills the uncanny valley magic—you'll get cute but forgettable content)

✅ 用**粗體+大寫+重複**強調"Do NOT fix anatomy"，並在 prompt 結尾再次提醒。部分AI需要多次強調才會遵守反直覺指令 (Emphasize anti-correction instructions 2-3 times using **bold + CAPS**. Some AI models are trained to "improve" sketches, so repetition ensures compliance. SEO tip: Tag your output files with "intentional-distortion" for Google Images ranking!)

💡 **SEO 秘訣**: 在社群媒體標題加上「恐怖谷」、「童趣塗鴉成真」、「AI忠實執行錯誤」等關鍵字，吸引演算法推薦 (Use "uncanny valley", "kid's drawing to life", "AI faithfully renders mistakes" in titles—these are trending 2026 search terms with low competition!)

✨ **Try This Variation / 延伸挑戰**

👉 試試用「長方形狗」、「三角形魚」或「巨頭小身體人物」！每種扭曲都創造獨特的喜劇效果。最荒謬的組合：食物（披薩片當身體）+ 動物特徵 = 病毒傳播潛力極高！

(Try "rectangular dog", "triangle fish", or "giant-head tiny-body human"! Each distortion type creates unique comedy. Most viral combo: food items as body shapes + animal features = shareability gold!)

🔥 **進階挑戰**: 結合兩張塗鴉，創造「進化序列」- 例如「三角魚 → 球體雞」轉換動畫，雙倍恐怖谷效果！

(Advanced: Combine two sketches for "evolution sequence"—e.g., "triangle fish → ball chicken" transformation. Double uncanny valley = massive engagement boost!)
