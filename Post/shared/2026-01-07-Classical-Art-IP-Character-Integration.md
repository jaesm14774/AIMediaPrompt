```
A museum-quality oil painting in the style of **[艺术风格 with: "17th century Dutch Golden Age (Rembrandt and Vermeer)" / "Italian Renaissance (Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael)" / "French Impressionism (Monet and Renoir)" / "Japanese Ukiyo-e woodblock print (Hokusai and Hiroshige)"]**, depicting **[IP 角色：Kirby / Mario / Pikachu / Totoro]** as a natural inhabitant of that historical era, rendered with period-accurate artistic techniques and complete style consistency.

**Style Authenticity (CRITICAL):** The [IP 角色] is painted entirely using the historical art movement's techniques—NOT modern digital cartoon style overlaid on classical background. For oil painting: visible brushstroke texture, craquelure (age cracks), impasto technique, canvas weave texture. For Ukiyo-e: woodblock print grain, flat color areas with deliberate outlines, traditional pigment palette (indigo, vermillion, yellow ochre).

**Seamless Integration:** The character's form follows the artistic conventions of the era. Chiaroscuro lighting (dramatic light-shadow contrast) for Baroque/Dutch Golden Age. Sfumato (soft edge blending) for Renaissance. Broken color technique and loose brushwork for Impressionism. Flattened perspective and decorative patterns for Ukiyo-e. The character casts historically accurate shadows, interacts with period-specific props (quill pen, harpsichord, samurai sword, parasol), wears era-appropriate costumes.

**Color Grading & Palette:** Match the historical color palette exactly. Dutch Golden Age: burnt sienna, raw umber, ultramarine blue, lead white. Renaissance: terre verte underpainting, vermillion red, lapis lazuli blue. Impressionism: pastel tones with visible color mixing. Ukiyo-e: limited flat colors (Prussian blue, cinnabar red, yellow ochre). Apply period-specific aging effects—varnish yellowing for old oil paintings, faded pigments for prints.

**Composition & Setting:** Place the character in a historically accurate environment. Dutch Golden Age: dimly lit interior with window light, rich textile drapes, still life objects (silver pitcher, fruit bowl). Renaissance: ornate palazzo with marble columns, garden loggia, religious iconography. Impressionism: outdoor garden scene with dappled sunlight, water reflections. Ukiyo-e: stylized landscape with Mount Fuji, cherry blossoms, geometric waves.

**Technical Specs:** High resolution scan quality (8K for oil paintings to show brushstroke detail, 4K for prints to show woodblock grain). Realistic aging artifacts—fine cracks in oil paint surface, foxing spots on paper prints, subtle color fading. Frame the artwork as if photographed in a museum—slight vignette, soft gallery lighting from above, optional ornate period frame visible at edges.

**Character Adaptation:** The [IP 角色] retains recognizable features but adopts the era's aesthetic—simplified/idealized anatomy for Renaissance, exaggerated emotion for Baroque, soft edges for Impressionism, bold outlines for Ukiyo-e. Kirby example: round pink form rendered with Rembrandt's chiaroscuro, two dot eyes painted with impasto white highlights, rosy cheeks as subtle vermillion glaze.

📝 **Example / 指令范例**

```
A museum-quality oil painting in the style of **17th century Dutch Golden Age (Rembrandt and Vermeer)**, depicting **Kirby** as a natural inhabitant of that historical era, rendered with period-accurate artistic techniques and complete style consistency.

**Style Authenticity (CRITICAL):** Kirby is painted entirely using Dutch Golden Age techniques—NOT modern digital cartoon style overlaid on classical background. Visible thick brushstrokes in impasto technique (especially on Kirby's pink body highlights), natural canvas weave texture showing through thin paint layers, fine craquelure cracks across the entire surface simulating 400-year-old varnish aging. The painting uses historically accurate pigments: lead white mixed with vermillion for Kirby's pink tones, burnt umber for deep shadows, ultramarine blue for background drapery.

**Seamless Integration:** Kirby is illuminated by Rembrandt's signature chiaroscuro—strong directional light from upper left creating dramatic shadow on the right side of the round body, with a subtle reflected light bounce from a silver platter on the table. Kirby sits on a richly embroidered velvet cushion (painted with meticulous textile folds), one stubby arm resting on an open leather-bound book, the other holding a wooden quill pen. Background shows a Vermeer-style interior: diamond-paned window with soft diffused daylight, Turkish carpet hanging on the wall, brass candlestick, and ceramic Delft Blue vase with tulips.

**Color Grading & Palette:** Exact Dutch Golden Age palette—Kirby's body is NOT bright bubblegum pink but muted rose madder with burnt sienna shadows and lead white highlights. Background uses raw umber, van Dyke brown, and Prussian blue. The entire painting has a warm amber varnish tone overlay (simulating aged linseed oil), creating a unified golden glow. Selective color saturation: only Kirby's cheeks and the tulips have vibrant hues, rest is desaturated earth tones.

**Composition & Setting:** Three-quarter view portrait composition (classic Dutch burgher portrait format). Kirby positioned slightly off-center following the rule of thirds. Foreground: dark wooden table with still life arrangement (half-peeled lemon, silver wine goblet, pocket watch). Middle ground: Kirby on cushion. Background: softly lit interior with atmospheric perspective fading into shadow. A small window at top-left provides the key light source, visible as a bright rectangle creating the Vermeer "pearl" effect.

**Technical Specs:** 8K resolution museum scan showing every brushstroke—visible thick impasto ridges catching light, thin glaze layers in shadow areas, pentimenti (artist's corrections) faintly visible where Kirby's arm position was adjusted. Realistic aging: fine craquelure pattern (age cracks forming irregular polygons), slight canvas sagging, subtle varnish discoloration to warm yellow-brown. Photographed under museum gallery lighting—soft overhead LED creating gentle vignette at edges, slight lens distortion from protective glass, ornate gilded Dutch frame partially visible at borders.

**Character Adaptation:** Kirby retains the iconic round pink form and dot eyes, but rendered with 17th-century painting conventions—soft sfumato edges (no hard outlines), anatomical modeling through chiaroscuro (round volume suggested by gradual light-to-shadow transition), expressive pose (slight tilt suggesting contemplation). The two dot eyes are painted as small impasto highlights of lead white with a glaze of raw umber for depth, creating the "spark of life" seen in Rembrandt portraits. Rosy cheeks rendered as delicate vermillion glaze, barely visible unless viewed up close—mimicking the subtle blush in Vermeer's Girl with a Pearl Earring.

💡 **Key Parameters / 关键参数解析**

- **Craquelure (age cracks)**: 最关键的真实感参数！模拟 400 年油画表面的细密裂纹，让 AI 生成「真的很老」的视觉效果，而不是崭新的数字画作 (The CRITICAL realism parameter! Simulates 400-year-old fine cracks on oil painting surface, making AI generate "genuinely aged" visual effect instead of fresh digital art—key SEO term: "antique painting simulation")

- **Chiaroscuro (明暗对照法)**: Rembrandt 和 Caravaggio 的招牌光影技法，强烈的光暗对比创造戏剧性体积感—这是巴洛克艺术的灵魂 (Rembrandt and Caravaggio's signature lighting technique, dramatic light-dark contrast creates theatrical volume—the soul of Baroque art. Trending in AI art history recreation 2026)

- **Impasto technique (厚涂法)**: 可见的厚重笔触，油彩堆叠形成凸起质感（尤其在高光处），这是区分「AI 模仿油画」和「真正理解油画技法」的分水岭 (Visible thick brushstrokes creating raised texture especially in highlights—the watershed distinguishing "AI imitating oil paintings" from "truly understanding oil painting techniques")

- **Period-accurate pigment names (历史颜料名称)**: 用 "burnt sienna, ultramarine blue, vermillion" 而非 "brown, blue, red"，让 AI 生成符合该时代真实调色板的色调 (Using "burnt sienna, ultramarine blue, vermillion" instead of "brown, blue, red" makes AI generate tones matching the era's authentic color palette—SEO keyword: "historical pigment accuracy in AI art")

- **Pentimenti (画家修改痕迹)**: 艺术史专业术语，指画布下隐约可见的原始构图修改（如手臂位置调整），这种细节让画作有「人类创作过程」的真实感 (Art history professional term, faintly visible original composition corrections beneath the canvas (like arm position adjustments)—this detail gives the "human creative process" authenticity that boosts museum-quality perception)

🎨 **Pro Tips / 专家建议**

❌ **新手常犯错误**：只写 "Kirby in Rembrandt style"，AI 会生成「现代数字卡通 Kirby + 棕色滤镜背景」，而不是「用 17 世纪油画技法从零绘制的 Kirby」 (Common beginner mistake: Just writing "Kirby in Rembrandt style" produces "modern digital cartoon Kirby + brown filter background" instead of "Kirby painted from scratch using 17th-century oil techniques")

✅ **正确做法**：用 "NOT modern digital cartoon style" 明确排除，再用专业术语（craquelure, impasto, chiaroscuro）强制 AI 理解「风格不是滤镜，而是完整的绘画技法重现」 (Correct approach: Use "NOT modern digital cartoon style" to explicitly exclude, then use professional terms (craquelure, impasto, chiaroscuro) to force AI to understand "style isn't a filter, but complete painting technique recreation"—this boosted my art history accuracy from 60% to 98%)

💡 **SEO 秘诀**: 在档名加上艺术史关键字如 "rembrandt-style-ai", "classical-painting-fusion", "dutch-golden-age-recreation"，提升 Google Images 和 Pinterest 搜寻排名。这类「古典艺术 × 流行 IP」的视觉双关在 2026 年是艺术类 AI 内容的蓝海市场！ (Add art history keywords like "rembrandt-style-ai", "classical-painting-fusion" to file names for Google Images SEO. This "classical art × pop IP" visual pun is a 2026 blue ocean in art AI content!)
