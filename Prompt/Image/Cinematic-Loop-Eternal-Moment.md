### Cinematic Loop: Eternal Moment

完美循環的電影級時刻，開頭與結尾無縫銜接

---

## Prompt Template

A seamless 5-second cinematic looping sequence capturing **[主角 / Kirby / lone wanderer / cosmic entity]** in [循環場景 with: "walking through endless field of floating lanterns that regenerate" / "standing at cliff edge as time cycles from sunset to sunrise to sunset" / "orbiting around a central object in zero-gravity space" / "caught in a time loop - same action repeating with slight variations"], filmed with meditative cinematography - hypnotic camera motion, natural loop points, atmospheric depth, and satisfying visual rhythm that makes viewers want to watch repeatedly.

**Timing Breakdown:**
- **0-1.2s**: Establishing movement - camera fades in from 80% opacity to full clarity over 0.3s (soft entry). Character positioned in lower-right third of frame (rule of thirds composition), moving [運動方向 with: "left to right across frame" / "toward camera in slow approach" / "in circular orbit (clockwise)" / "forward through environment"]. Environment rich with atmospheric depth: [環境描述 with: "dreamy pastel sky with volumetric clouds, endless horizon" / "bioluminescent forest with glowing flora pulsing rhythmically" / "cosmic nebula with stars and floating asteroids" / "misty mountain peaks emerging from fog layer"]. Camera motion: slow lateral tracking matching character's movement OR slow push-in OR gentle orbital rotation (consistent throughout full 5s). Lighting: soft, diffused, natural - golden hour glow or ethereal moonlight. Foreground elements (grass, particles, mist) create parallax depth.

- **1.2-2.5s**: Rhythmic elements introduction - environmental features begin their cycle. If lanterns: they drift upward and fade at top of frame while new ones materialize at bottom (continuous flow). If time cycle: lighting gradually shifts from warm sunset orange toward cooler twilight purple. If orbit: background stars slowly rotate opposite to character motion (creating depth). If time loop: subtle déjà vu visual cues appear (faint echo trail of character, environment glitches briefly at 2.0s). Camera maintains steady, hypnotic motion. Character animation loops smoothly - walking cycle, floating idle, or gentle rotation. Midpoint of video achieved - compositionally balanced for loop restart.

- **2.5-4s**: Peak atmospheric saturation - environment reaches its most visually rich state. Maximum particle density (fireflies, snow, sparkles, floating petals - whatever fits theme), volumetric lighting at optimal visibility (god rays, rim lighting, atmospheric haze), color grading at peak saturation. Character crosses center frame at 3.2s (natural focal point). Background elements continue their cycles - clouds drift, water ripples, stars twinkle, plants sway. Everything moving but nothing chaotic - zen-like harmony. Sound design (if applicable) reaches its fullest texture - layered ambient loops, rhythmic nature sounds, subtle musical motif.

- **4-5s**: Seamless loop preparation - this is critical for perfect looping. Camera position and character position must mathematically return close to 0s state. Character moves to lower-right third (matching 0s position). Environmental elements that appeared at start cycle out while new ones cycle in (maintaining continuous flow). Lighting subtly transitions back toward starting tone. At 4.7s, gentle fade begins (opacity 100% → 95%) to help mask loop seam. Final frame (4.95s) visually similar to frame 0.05s - same character position, same camera angle, same environmental density. When video loops, viewer perceives continuous eternal motion rather than a hard cut.

**Loop Engineering:**
- Character ends in same position/pose as start (or imperceptibly close)
- Camera completes exact 360° rotation OR returns to start position OR maintains continuous motion that's identical frame 0 to frame 5
- Environmental cycles (lanterns, clouds, particles) use modular timing - elements have 1.25s, 1.67s, or 2.5s individual cycles so multiple fit within 5s
- Color grading uses circular transition - if starts warm, cycles through cool, returns to warm
- No hard resets - everything transitions smoothly, nothing "pops" back to start

**Technical Specifications:**
- Resolution: 4K (3840x2160), 60fps for smooth motion (can export to 30fps for smaller file size)
- Aspect Ratio: 1:1 (Instagram loop), 16:9 (YouTube ambient video), 9:16 (Stories/TikTok)
- Camera: Gimbal-stabilized smooth motion (lateral tracking at 10cm/s, orbital at 72°/s, push-in at 5cm/s) - NO sudden movements
- Loop Duration: Exactly 5.00 seconds (150 frames at 30fps, 300 frames at 60fps)
- Depth Layers: Minimum 4 layers (foreground particles, character, midground environment, background sky/space) each with different parallax speeds
- Color Grading: Harmonious palette (analogous colors), slight vignette, film grain (subtle), no harsh contrast
- VFX: Particle systems (looping cycles), volumetric lighting, atmospheric haze, optional light leaks, chromatic aberration edges
- Sound Design: Seamless audio loop - ambient bed (nature sounds, space drone, wind), no percussive elements that would expose loop point
- Frame Blending: Use optical flow frame blending at loop point (blend frames 0 and 150) for ultra-smooth transition

## Example

A seamless 5-second cinematic looping sequence capturing **Kirby** in **walking through endless field of floating paper lanterns that regenerate**, filmed with meditative cinematography - hypnotic camera motion, natural loop points, atmospheric depth, and satisfying visual rhythm.

**Timing Breakdown:**
- **0-1.2s**: Establishing movement - camera fades in from 80% opacity over 0.3s. Kirby positioned in lower-right third, walking left to right at gentle pace. Environment: **dreamy twilight sky transitioning from lavender to peach, endless grassy meadow extending to hazy horizon, hundreds of glowing warm-white paper lanterns floating upward**. Camera motion: slow lateral tracking right (matching Kirby's walk at 10cm/s). Lighting: soft golden hour glow from setting sun behind camera, lanterns provide warm practical lighting. Foreground: tall grass gently swaying (parallax effect), closest lanterns slightly out of focus (f/2.8 depth).

- **1.2-2.5s**: Rhythmic lantern cycle - lanterns continuously drift upward at steady pace. Those reaching top of frame (6 meters up) begin fading out (opacity 100% → 0% over 0.5s). Simultaneously, new lanterns materialize at ground level behind Kirby (opacity 0% → 100% over 0.5s), maintaining constant density of ~50 lanterns visible. Camera continues steady tracking. Kirby's walking animation loops seamlessly - cheerful stride, arms swinging. Sky gradually shifts from peach toward deeper purple (time progression effect). At 2.0s, Kirby passes particularly large lantern (focal point).

- **2.5-4s**: Peak atmospheric saturation - environment at most visually rich. Maximum lantern density visible (50+ on screen), volumetric light rays from setting sun pierce through lantern gaps, warm rim lighting on Kirby's pink form, atmospheric haze adds depth. Fireflies join scene, twinkling among lanterns. Kirby crosses center frame at 3.2s (compositional focal point). Background mountains silhouette against purple-pink gradient sky. Grass continues gentle sway. Everything harmonious - zen atmosphere.

- **4-5s**: Seamless loop preparation - Kirby returns to lower-right third position (matching 0s). Lanterns continue eternal cycle (upward drift, fade out top, regenerate bottom). Sky completes color cycle, returning toward original lavender-peach. Camera tracking maintains constant speed. At 4.7s, gentle fade to 95% opacity. Final frame (4.95s): Kirby in nearly identical position to 0.05s - same stride pose, same screen position, same lantern density around. When loops, appears as if Kirby walks eternally through infinite field, lanterns forever rising.

**Loop Engineering:**
- Kirby's walk cycle: 8-frame loop (repeats 37.5 times in 5 seconds at 60fps)
- Lantern cycle: Each lantern takes 2.5s to rise from ground to top (2 complete cycles in 5s)
- Camera returns to exact start position
- Sky color uses circular gradient transition
- Grass sway uses sine wave animation (2.5s period)

**Technical Specifications:**
- Resolution: 4K (3840x2160), 60fps
- Aspect Ratio: 1:1 (perfect for Instagram loop)
- Camera: Gimbal lateral tracking at 10cm/s (right), perfectly stabilized
- Loop Duration: Exactly 5.00 seconds (300 frames at 60fps)
- Depth Layers: 5 layers (foreground grass blur, Kirby, midground lanterns, background mountains, sky)
- Color Grading: Warm sunset palette (lavender, peach, gold), slight vignette, fine film grain
- VFX: 50+ paper lanterns (particle system, 2.5s rise cycle), volumetric god rays, fireflies (random twinkle), atmospheric haze
- Sound Design: Gentle wind ambience, soft paper rustling, distant crickets chirping - all seamlessly looping
- Frame Blending: Optical flow blend between frames 299 and 0 for perfect loop
