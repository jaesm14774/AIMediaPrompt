### 天氣城市V2

Generate a vertical composition image viewed from a clear 45-degree top-down perspective.

A detailed isometric miniature city of **[城市名稱]** sits physically attached to **[IP 角色名稱]**, as if the city is being **[承載方式：held / balanced / worn / supported / emerging from]** by the character's body. The city is not floating independently — its weight and placement are visually justified by the character.

The current weather **[天氣描述：溫度＋狀態]** is expressed as a direct result of the IP character's **[身體部位或行為：mouth / breath / expression / posture]**, transforming into **[具體天氣效果：wind / clouds / rain / mist / sunlight]** that flows through and interacts with the city and surrounding space.

The IP character dominates the composition, with the city functioning as an extension of the character rather than the main subject.

Thin, minimal city base or no visible base at all.

Physically Based Rendering (PBR), soft realistic lighting, clean solid-color background.

At the top of the image, display **[城市名稱]** and **[天氣描述]**, accompanied by a simple weather icon that visually echoes the character's state.
