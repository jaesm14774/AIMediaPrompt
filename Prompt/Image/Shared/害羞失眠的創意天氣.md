## Prompt Template

A dramatic cinematic photograph of **[角色名：Kirby / 創作者 / 學生]** lying awake in bed at [時間 with: 深夜時間點 / "3 AM, staring at ceiling with wide eyes, body tense and restless" / "2 AM, clutching pillow, mind racing visibly" / "midnight, sitting up abruptly as another idea strikes"], surrounded by a chaotic weather storm manifesting the internal struggle: [情緒天氣組合 with: 害羞與創意的衝突天氣 / "violent golden lightning-ideas crackling through the room, but immediately retreating into bashful pink thunder-clouds the moment they appear, creating a flickering on-off visual rhythm" / "explosive amber creativity-tornado swirling from the head, but being pushed back by waves of rose-tinted shyness-fog, ideas half-formed and retreating" / "cascading golden thought-lightning bolts shooting upward, colliding mid-air with descending blush-colored doubt-storm clouds, creating spectacular but agonizing sparks"].

The bedroom is in complete disarray from the emotional weather chaos: sheets violently billowing from thought-winds, notebook pages flying and swirling in the creative tornado, scattered sketches plastering against walls, desk lamp swaying wildly casting dramatic moving shadows. The weather creates intense visible conflict—golden lightning-ideas illuminate the room in sharp flashes before being smothered by pink shyness-clouds; half-written thoughts materialize as glowing text fragments in mid-air but dissolve into pink mist before completion; brilliant idea-symbols (lightbulbs, equations, melodies, sketches) burst forth then immediately curl up and hide.

The character's expression shows the agony: eyes wide open, mouth slightly agape in exhausted frustration, one hand reaching toward a brilliant idea-lightning bolt, the other hand covering face in shy retreat. Hair windswept by the thought-storm. Body language torn between sitting up to capture ideas and curling up to hide from self-doubt.

Dramatic high-contrast lighting: intense golden lightning flashes against deep purple-black night, with intermittent soft pink glow-and-fade from shyness-clouds. Volumetric storm effects with visible weather violence. Dynamic diagonal composition emphasizing chaos and movement. Shot from a dramatic low-angle capturing the ceiling storm and bed simultaneously. Cinematic color grading: storm movie aesthetic with saturated golds, deep magentas, and inky blacks. Motion blur on weather elements, sharp focus on agonized expression. Film grain, anamorphic lens flare from lightning strikes. 4K resolution. Visual style inspired by disaster movie cinematography meets Pixar's *Inside Out* emotional intensity.
