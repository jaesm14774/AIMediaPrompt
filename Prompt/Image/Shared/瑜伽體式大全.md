## Prompt Template

A professional yoga instructional photography series featuring **[角色名稱 / Kirby / any round character / Jigglypuff]** demonstrating [瑜伽主題 with: "classic Hatha yoga poses from beginner to advanced levels" / "playful animal-inspired poses - cat, cow, downward dog, cobra" / "challenging balance poses - tree, warrior, eagle, crow" / "restorative relaxation poses - child's pose, corpse pose, happy baby"].

The layout shows 8-12 different yoga positions arranged in flowing organic composition against a serene gradient background (soft transition from pale lavender to warm cream, evoking peaceful yoga studio ambiance). Dynamic size hierarchy creates natural visual flow: 2-3 featured poses dominate as large hero demonstrations (warrior stance attempt, tree pose wobbling, downward dog confusion), 4-6 medium-sized poses show key asanas from optimal teaching angles (side profile alignment, frontal symmetry, 45-degree depth), and smaller detail shots capture transitions and close-ups. Poses scattered naturally with playful rotation - some upright, some tilted, one upside-down - avoiding rigid grid structure. Occasional gentle overlap between poses creates depth, while breathing room around featured demonstrations allows focus. Visual rhythm flows like a yoga sequence itself.

Shot with professional wellness photography aesthetic - soft diffused natural lighting streaming from large windows (5000K color temperature), creating gentle shadows that define rounded form without harsh contrast. Varying depth of field adds dimension: shallow focus (f/2.8) on featured hero poses with dreamy bokeh separation, slightly deeper (f/4-f/5.6) on instructional mid-sized poses keeping character and mat props in focus. Composition on natural fiber yoga mat (soft gray or sage green) with optional props scattered organically: cork yoga blocks, cotton strap, round bolster pillow placed naturally rather than symmetrically.

Captured with Canon EOS R5, RF 50mm f/1.2 lens, natural color grading emphasizing warm peaceful tones (soft pinks, creams, gentle earth tones). Clean modern instructional style reminiscent of Yoga Journal magazine photography and Alo Moves tutorial aesthetics, but with organic layout rather than clinical grid. Each pose shows character's endearing attempt to embody the asana despite spherical anatomy - some poses naturally fitting (ball pose perfectly spherical, child's pose as contented curl) while others hilariously impossible (warrior lunge with no legs, splits as gentle compression, tree pose wobbling charmingly). Subtle ambient elements enhance peaceful atmosphere: soft window light creating natural gradient across frame, potted succulent visible in background, rolled mat edge peeking at corner, peaceful minimalist environment supporting rather than distracting. Overall composition feels like browsing through an inspiring yoga teacher's practice journal.

## Example

A professional yoga instructional photography series featuring Kirby demonstrating classic Hatha yoga poses from beginner to advanced levels.

The layout shows 8-12 different yoga positions arranged in flowing organic composition against a serene gradient background (soft transition from pale lavender to warm cream, evoking peaceful yoga studio ambiance). Dynamic size hierarchy creates natural visual flow: large hero demonstration of Kirby attempting warrior stance (comically legless but earnest) dominates upper left, tree pose wobbling charmingly occupies right side, downward dog shown as confused rolling position anchors bottom composition. Medium-sized poses scattered between show side profile ball pose (perfect sphere), frontal view child's pose (contented curl), 45-degree angle cobra attempt. Smaller detail shots capture transition moments and close-ups of Kirby's determined expression. Some poses tilted playfully (upside-down happy baby), one rotated sideways (resting twist), creating dynamic rather than rigid structure. Gentle overlap where smaller poses nestle near larger ones adds depth, while breathing room around hero poses allows appreciation.

Shot with professional wellness photography aesthetic - soft diffused natural lighting streaming from large studio windows (5000K color temperature), creating gentle shadows defining Kirby's rounded pink form without harsh contrast. Varying depth of field adds dimension: hero warrior pose has dreamy shallow bokeh (f/2.8) with sage green yoga mat fading into creamy background, instructional medium poses use f/4 keeping Kirby and cork yoga blocks crisp, detail shots deepen slightly to f/5.6 showing peaceful studio context. Natural fiber yoga mat and props (cotton strap draped naturally, round bolster pillow) scattered organically rather than symmetrically arranged.

Captured with Canon EOS R5, RF 50mm f/1.2 lens, natural color grading emphasizing warm peaceful tones blending Kirby's vibrant pink with soft cream highlights and subtle lavender shadows. Clean modern instructional style reminiscent of Yoga Journal magazine photography and Alo Moves tutorial aesthetics, but flowing layout rather than clinical grid. Each pose shows Kirby's endearing attempt: ball pose and child's pose fit perfectly (natural sphere state), while warrior lunge, splits, and tree pose create hilarious impossible moments full of charm. Subtle ambient elements: soft window light creating natural gradient, potted succulent visible upper right corner, rolled mat edge peeking bottom left, peaceful minimalist environment. Overall composition feels like browsing beloved yoga teacher's inspiring practice journal.
