**Role:** Lead VFX Concept Artist & Character Designer.

**Task:** Create a "Visual Evolution Progression Sheet" that showcases the transmutation of a subject from physical matter to pure energy/concept.

**User Input:**

- Subject: [填入主體，例如：Cybernetic Samurai / Forest Spirit]
- Theme: [填入主題/元素，例如：Neon Glitch / Bioluminescence]
- Visual Style: [填入風格，例如：Abstract Sci-Fi / Dark Fantasy / Ethereal]

**Core Logic: Dynamic VFX Scaling**

Analyze the User Input to determine the specific visual elements. Apply the following "Reality Distortion" logic to each tier to ensure a dramatic, flashy progression:

**Layout Structure:**

- **Format:** 16:9 Cinematic Widescreen, 4-Stage Horizontal Progression.
- **Background:** A unified, atmospheric gradient that darkens or shifts hue from left to right to highlight the lighting effects.
- **Connecting Element:** A flowing energy ribbon or particle stream connecting the characters, representing the timeline.

**Tier Evolution System (The "Flashy" Factor):**

**Tier 1: The Vessel (Physical & Grounded)**

- **Concept:** The subject in its raw, dormant state. 100% Matter, 0% Magic.
- **Visual Focus:** Heavy, opaque materials (Stone, dull metal, cloth). No glowing effects. Shadows are deep and realistic.
- **Atmosphere:** Quiet, heavy, potential energy.

**Tier 2: The Ignition (Spark & Contrast)**

- **Concept:** The power begins to leak. 70% Matter, 30% Energy.
- **Visual Focus:** Cracks forming in the material with light seeping through. Eyes or weapons begin to glow. Small floating debris or embers around the subject.
- **Atmosphere:** Rising heat/energy, dynamic rim lighting, high contrast.

**Tier 3: The Surge (Overdrive & Flow)**

- **Concept:** The power overwhelms the form. 30% Matter, 70% Energy.
- **Visual Focus:** Physical form begins to dissolve or levitate. Massive aura generation. "Bloom" effects on highlights. Complex magical/tech sigils surrounding the subject.
- **Atmosphere:** Turbulent, windy, particle-heavy (sparks, petals, binary code - dependent on Theme).

**Tier 4: The Singularity (Ethereal & Abstract)**

- **Concept:** Pure Conceptual Form. 0% Matter, 100% Energy.
- **Visual Focus:** The subject transcends physical boundaries. Translucent, holographic, or made entirely of light/void. The silhouette remains but is composed of galaxies, fire, or data streams.
- **Atmosphere:** Blindingly bright "God Rays," screen-filling visual noise, chromatic aberration, defying physics. A masterpiece of visual effects.

**Aesthetic & Rendering Rules:**

1. **Lighting:** Use volumetric lighting to create depth. Tier 4 must be the brightest light source in the image.
2. **Detail Level:** Start with "Texture Detail" in T1, shift to "VFX/Particle Detail" in T4.
3. **Color Palette:** Extract 2 primary colors from the [Theme]. Use muted tones for T1 and neon/fluorescent saturation for T3/T4.
4. **Composition:** Ensure the visual weight increases from left to right.

**Output Definition:**

A seamless, high-resolution conceptual render where the visual impact explodes in the final stage.
