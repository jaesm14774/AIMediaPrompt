## Prompt Template

A magical character sticker pack design rendered in Pixar Animation Studios cinematography style, featuring **[角色名稱 / Kirby / any beloved character / Totoro]** expressing [情緒主題 with: "daily life emotions - joy, surprise, confusion, sleepiness, excitement, contentment" / "reaction stickers - thumbs up, heart eyes, crying, laughing, shocked, tired" / "seasonal moods - spring cheerful, summer energetic, autumn cozy, winter peaceful" / "communication expressions - hello wave, goodbye, thinking, celebrating, encouraging, comforting"].

The enchanting composition displays 12-16 expressive poses arranged in playful scattered layout against a dreamy gradient background (soft transition from twilight blue to warm peachy-pink, reminiscent of Pixar's signature magic hour lighting). Dynamic size variety creates visual interest: 3-4 hero emotion poses rendered larger (bouncing joy, starry-eyed wonder, triumphant celebration), 6-8 medium expressions at standard sticker size (sleeping curl, curious tilt, shy peek, loving gesture), and smaller accent poses add charm (tiny excited sparkle, micro yawn). Poses scattered organically with delightful rotation - some upright, some tilted playfully, occasional upside-down giggle - avoiding rigid grid structure. Gentle overlap where smaller stickers nestle near larger ones creates depth and personality, while negative space around featured emotions allows each to breathe and shine. Visual rhythm flows like watching character come alive through emotional journey.

Illuminated with Pixar's iconic three-point lighting magic varying across poses: warm key light (2800K golden glow) creating soft highlights on character's surface, gentle rim lighting outlining silhouette with ethereal luminescence (cooler blue-purple 5500K for contrast), and subtle subsurface scattering making character appear to glow from within like a sentient plush toy. Larger hero poses receive more dramatic lighting with pronounced rim glow and particle effects, while smaller poses use softer ambient fill. Each pose radiates subtle magical particles scaled to size - larger stickers have floating sparkles and light wisps, medium stickers show gentle bokeh orbs, tiny stickers emit warm dust motes catching light (inspired by Toy Story's living toy essence and Inside Out's emotion energy). Particle density and glow intensity varies creating depth hierarchy.

Rendered in Pixar's RenderMan engine aesthetic: perfect balance of appealing stylization and believable texture, soft shadows with ambient occlusion depth, rich saturated colors with painterly warmth (coral pinks, buttery yellows, sky blues, mint greens). Each expression meticulously crafted with appeal and personality - squash-and-stretch principles applied (compressed for landing poses, stretched for jumping/reaching), expressive body language despite simple form, eyes and facial features conveying genuine emotion from subtle contentment to explosive excitement. Composition uses negative space elegantly with organic scattered arrangement rather than uniform grid, allowing visual flow and rhythm. Subtle drop shadows beneath each pose scaled appropriately (larger shadows for bigger stickers, delicate shadows for tiny ones) creating gentle lift effect and floating sensation. Optional transparent background for clean sticker-ready output. Photography style evokes Pixar's character development art, Toy Story's emotional warmth, and Studio Ghibli's soulful charm, with layout feeling like character's emotions bursting naturally across the canvas.

## Example

A magical character sticker pack design rendered in Pixar Animation Studios cinematography style, featuring Kirby expressing daily life emotions - joy, surprise, confusion, sleepiness, excitement, contentment.

The enchanting composition displays 12-16 expressive poses arranged in playful scattered layout against a dreamy gradient background (soft transition from twilight blue to warm peachy-pink, reminiscent of Pixar's signature magic hour lighting). Dynamic size variety creates visual interest: large hero bouncing joy Kirby (stretched upward energetically) dominates center-left, starry-eyed wonder Kirby (leaning back with amazed glow) anchors right side, triumphant celebration (raised arms victorious) crowns upper composition. Medium-sized expressions scattered throughout: sleeping curl (perfect sphere with closed eyes and tiny "zzz"), curious tilt (leaning inquisitively), shy peek (partially hidden with bashful blush), loving heart gesture (radiating affection), peaceful meditation (serene sitting), gentle hug pose (arms outstretched warmly). Smaller accent poses add charm: tiny excited jump with sparkles, micro stretching yawn, mini upside-down giggle rotated playfully. Poses tilted naturally - some upright, others rotated 15-30 degrees, occasional full inversion - avoiding rigid grid. Gentle overlap where smaller stickers nestle beside larger ones creates depth.

Illuminated with Pixar's iconic three-point lighting magic varying across poses: hero joy pose receives warm key light (2800K golden glow) creating pronounced highlights on smooth pink surface with dramatic blue-purple rim lighting (5500K) outlining silhouette, moderate subsurface scattering making Kirby glow from within. Medium poses use softer balanced lighting with gentle rim accents. Smaller poses have ambient fill with subtle edge glow. Each pose radiates magical particles scaled appropriately: large joy sticker has floating sparkles and light wisps bursting outward, medium stickers show gentle bokeh orbs, tiny stickers emit delicate warm dust motes (Toy Story + Inside Out essence). Particle density creates depth hierarchy.

Rendered in Pixar's RenderMan engine aesthetic: perfect balance of appealing stylization and believable texture, soft shadows with ambient occlusion depth, rich saturated colors with painterly warmth (vibrant pink, buttery cream highlights, sky blue accents, subtle lavender shadows). Each expression shows squash-and-stretch principles: compressed ball for landing meditation, stretched reaching for celebration, natural sphere for sleeping. Eyes and cheek blush convey genuine emotion. Organic scattered composition with elegant negative space creates natural visual flow like emotions bursting across canvas. Subtle drop shadows scaled appropriately beneath each pose create floating sensation - larger shadows for hero stickers, delicate shadows for tiny accents. Photography style evokes Pixar's character development art warmth and Studio Ghibli's soulful charm.
