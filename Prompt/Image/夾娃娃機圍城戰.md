---

## Prompt Template

Epic war movie cinematography shot from ground-level perspective inside a UFO catcher machine. A massive pyramid fortress built from stacked orange-yellow Waddle Dee plushies (Kirby series characters with round penguin-like bodies, cream-colored faces, small black dot eyes). [Defense scenario: "Front-line Waddle Dees forming shield wall formation, determined expressions facing upward, backlit by blue LED arcade lighting creating heroic silhouettes" / "Waddle Dees scrambling in panic as pyramid structure begins to collapse, some tumbling down, dust particles flying, dramatic action scene" / "Brave Waddle Dee commander standing at pyramid peak, rallying troops below, one arm raised (plushies don't have arms but posed heroically), sunset-like orange glow behind" / "Stealth night raid scene with sleeping Waddle Dees suddenly awakened, half-open eyes, emergency pink LED lights flashing"]. Giant mechanical claw descending from above like an alien mothership, chrome metal reflecting neon lights, casting ominous shadow over the plush fortress. Transparent glass walls visible in background showing blurred arcade exterior. Volumetric fog from arcade smoke machine, dramatic rim lighting separating each plush toy layer, shallow depth of field with focus on foreground heroes. Shot from Waddle Dee eye-level (15cm height) making everything feel massive and threatening. Cinematic color grading: desaturated blues and oranges with selective warm glows on character faces. "LAST STAND" text overlay in military stencil font. War film aesthetic inspired by Saving Private Ryan beach landing scene, 8K resolution, anamorphic lens flare, film grain texture.
