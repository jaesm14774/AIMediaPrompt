### 惡夢加班鏡像

鏡面分割顛覆夢境刻板印象：現實安詳睡眠 vs 夢中瘋狂加班的荒謬惡夢

---

## Prompt Template

A darkly comedic split-screen composition showing **[在此填入角色名 / 範例: Kirby / 疲憊上班族 / 冒險者角色]** in absurd nightmare-reality inversion, divided by a vertical glowing mirror line cutting through the center of the frame.

Left side (Peaceful Reality): The character sleeping serenely in [安詳現實 with: 選擇平靜場景 / "cozy bedroom, curled peacefully under soft blanket, gentle moonlight casting calm shadows, warm color palette with安心 atmosphere" / "simple futon in quiet apartment, relaxed side-sleeping pose, night lamp creating soft glow, minimalist tranquil environment" / "comfortable couch, sprawled in完全放鬆 position with content smile, dawn light filtering softly through curtains"], rendered in warm, soft-focus cinematic style emphasizing physical rest and peace.

Right side (Nightmare Office Hell): The same character trapped in [夢中惡夢 with: 選擇加班惡夢 / "infinite dystopian office labyrinth, frantically running between endless desks while paperwork multiplies exponentially, harsh fluorescent hellscape with distorted perspective creating claustrophobic panic" / "sinking into ocean of coffee cups and keyboards, desperate swimming motion mid-air, surreal Dali-esque melting office equipment, anxiety-inducing color grading with sickly green-yellow tones" / "chased by giant floating Excel spreadsheets and calendar deadlines, exaggerated cartoon panic expression, absurd game-boss-battle composition with UI elements gone haywire"], rendered in surreal nightmare illustration style with exaggerated proportions, distorted perspective, and anxiety-amplifying visual chaos.

The mirror dividing line represents the cruel irony: reality offers rest, but the mind creates work hell. Subtle visual cues show exhaustion transferring through mirror - sweat drops on reality side correspond to panic tears on nightmare side. Left side shows body resting, right side shows mind suffering.

Atmosphere: Darkly comic contrast subverting "dreams as escape" trope. Left side uses gentle cinematography - soft focus, warm amber tones, peaceful stillness. Right side uses anxiety horror aesthetics - fish-eye lens distortion, nauseating color shifts, motion blur suggesting frantic activity, floating UI nightmares (error pop-ups, infinite email notifications rendered as physical monsters). The mirror line pulses ominously, suggesting the thin barrier between earned rest and mental torture.

Technical execution: Cinematic photography on reality side (shallow depth of field, film grain, cozy bokeh), surreal horror illustration on nightmare side (Kafka meets Office Space meets Hieronymus Bosch - exaggerated limbs, impossible architecture, visual metaphors made literal). Perfect ironic symmetry: calm sleeping pose on left mirrors desperate flailing on right. Composition mimics horror-comedy poster technique, emphasizing the absurd cruelty of anxiety dreams sabotaging well-deserved sleep.
