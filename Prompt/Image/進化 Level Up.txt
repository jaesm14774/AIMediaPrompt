### 進化 Level Up

Three-stage character lineup of a [1. 角色起點] transformed by [2. 轉變核心]. Horizontal progression from left to right, minimal background.

- **Stage 1:** Raw form — unrefined, holding basic tool, curious posture
- **Stage 2:** Awakened state — integrated [核心] into body/weapon, combat-ready stance, scars of training
- **Stage 3:** Perfected being — [核心] becomes part of identity, signature stance radiating quiet authority, no excessive glow

Emphasis on silhouette readability and design evolution over particle effects. Concept art, neutral lighting, character focused.
