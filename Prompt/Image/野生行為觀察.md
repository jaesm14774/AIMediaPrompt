## Prompt Template

A wildlife documentary photography series in the style of BBC Earth and National Geographic, scientifically documenting the natural behaviors of **[生物名稱 / Kirby / Pikachu / any cute creature]** in [棲息環境 with: "domestic habitat - cozy living room with scattered toys and soft cushions" / "natural meadow environment - wildflowers and soft grass under dappled sunlight" / "kitchen ecosystem - exploring countertops and food sources" / "bedroom sanctuary - nestled among pillows and blankets"].

The observational composition shows 10-15 candid behavioral moments organically scattered across the frame in varying sizes and angles, creating authentic documentary feel. Layout avoids rigid grid structure - instead featuring dynamic natural arrangement: larger hero shots of key behaviors (sleeping curled in perfect sphere, stretching after waking, curious investigation pose), medium-sized candid captures (playful rolling motion, contented resting, startled alert position), and intimate close-up details (feeding/eating behavior, grooming self, expressive face reactions). Some poses overlap slightly, others have breathing room, with occasional rotation (upside-down relaxed pose, sideways peeking around corners, belly-up trust position) creating playful visual rhythm against naturalistic environmental backgrounds.

Shot with premium wildlife photography equipment - Canon EOS R3 with EF 70-200mm f/2.8 telephoto lens capturing intimate moments from respectful distance, maintaining natural behavior documentation ethics. Soft natural lighting (golden hour warmth 4800K or overcast diffused light 6500K) creating authentic atmosphere. Varying depth of field across different shots: some with shallow bokeh (f/2.8) isolating subject dramatically, others with deeper focus (f/5.6) showing environmental context, sharp focus on character's expressive features while background elements create painterly depth.

Professional color grading with rich saturation emphasizing character's natural coloring against complementary environmental tones. Cinematic 16:9 aspect ratio with organic scattered composition rather than clinical grid. Photography aesthetic combines David Attenborough's Planet Earth intimate wildlife moments with Mitsuaki Iwago's cat photography tenderness and spontaneity. Each pose reveals genuine personality and charm through body language - some poses showing vulnerability (belly-up, sleeping), others displaying curiosity (stretched neck, forward lean), creating emotional connection through authentic behavioral documentation. Subtle film grain texture (ISO 400-800) adding organic documentary realism. Overall composition feels like a naturalist's field observation sketch brought to life.

## Example

A wildlife documentary photography series in the style of BBC Earth and National Geographic, scientifically documenting the natural behaviors of Kirby in domestic habitat - cozy living room with scattered toys and soft cushions.

The observational composition shows 10-15 candid behavioral moments organically scattered across the frame in varying sizes and angles, creating authentic documentary feel. Layout avoids rigid grid structure - instead featuring dynamic natural arrangement: larger hero shots of Kirby sleeping curled in perfect sphere and stretching after waking dominate the composition, medium-sized candid captures show playful rolling motion across soft rug and contented resting against cushion, with intimate close-up details revealing curious investigation pose (leaning forward toward toy) and grooming self. Some poses overlap slightly (upside-down Kirby partially behind resting Kirby), others have breathing room, with occasional rotation (sideways peeking around furniture corner, belly-up trust position showing pink underside) creating playful visual rhythm against warm living room backdrop with scattered plush toys and soft afternoon light.

Shot with premium wildlife photography equipment - Canon EOS R3 with EF 70-200mm f/2.8 telephoto lens capturing intimate moments from respectful distance, maintaining natural behavior documentation ethics. Soft natural lighting (golden hour warmth 4800K streaming through windows) creating authentic cozy atmosphere. Varying depth of field across different shots: hero sleeping pose has dreamy shallow bokeh (f/2.8) with plush cushions melting into creamy background, while environmental context shots use deeper focus (f/5.6) showing scattered toys and room details, tack-sharp focus on Kirby's smooth pink surface and expressive features throughout.

Professional color grading with rich saturation emphasizing Kirby's vibrant pink against complementary warm beige and soft blue environmental tones. Cinematic 16:9 aspect ratio with organic scattered composition feeling like a naturalist's beloved observation journal. Photography aesthetic combines David Attenborough's Planet Earth intimate wildlife moments with Mitsuaki Iwago's cat photography tenderness and spontaneity. Each pose reveals genuine personality and charm through body language - vulnerability in belly-up on soft rug and sleeping curled against cushion, curiosity in stretched upward investigating toy and forward lean toward camera, creating deep emotional connection through authentic behavioral documentation. Subtle film grain texture (ISO 640) adding organic documentary realism.
