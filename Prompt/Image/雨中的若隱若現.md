### 雨中的若隱若現

[Subject] partially obscured in heavy rainfall, where sheets of rain create natural veils between camera and figure. Emphasize atmospheric depth—silhouette emerging through rain curtains, details revealed in fleeting moments when wind shifts the downpour. Backlit by distant warm streetlights bleeding through the storm, rim lighting catching rain-soaked edges while face and form drift between shadow and brief clarity. Cool blue-gray dominates, punctuated by amber halos from unseen sources. Frame with rain as foreground blur, middle ground sharp enough to suggest wet fabric clinging to shoulders and chest, background dissolving into bokeh. Capture the tension of almost-seeing: water streaming down obscured features, body language readable through the haze, that K-drama moment where longing lives in what's hidden as much as what's shown.
