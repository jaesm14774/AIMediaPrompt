## Prompt Template

A dynamic 5-second costume transformation sequence filmed at 60fps in 4K resolution with explosive particle effects and rapid-fire costume changes, featuring **[角色 with: "Pikachu" / "Kirby" / "cute round penguin" / "fluffy white bunny"]** showcasing four festive outfits in rapid succession.

**Opening Frame (0-1s):** Soft watercolor-pastel illustration style background - grid paper texture in light blue (#E8F4F8) with faint 1cm squares. [主題背景 with: "Christmas: Bottom shows soft snow bank with pinecones and holly, top has winter foliage and Poké Ball ornament" / "New Year: Bottom shows scattered gold-silver confetti, top has '2025' in firework trails" / "Halloween: Bottom shows autumn leaves and pumpkins, top has bat silhouettes and crescent moon"]. Character appears in Costume 1, standing center frame in neutral pose. Hand-lettered orange text (#FF8C42) at top reads "CHOOSE YOUR FESTIVE [角色名稱]!" with playful wobble effect. Camera: static frontal shot, character fills 60% of frame. Soft diffused lighting from top-left (45-degree angle). Gentle anticipation - character's eyes sparkle, slight breathing animation.

**Rapid Transformation Sequence (1-3s):** EXPLOSIVE costume switching begins! At 1.0s mark, character spins 360 degrees at high speed (0.4 second spin) - during the spin blur, Costume 1 vanishes in a burst of pastel-colored confetti particles (pinks, blues, creams) and Costume 2 materializes with a soft "poof" of watercolor smoke effect. Character lands in cheerful pose. At 1.5s, character jumps upward - mid-air freeze frame (0.2s) with sparkle effects surrounding them, then drops down transformed into Costume 3 with a gentle bounce, small impact ripple in soft watercolor style spreads from feet. At 2.5s, character does a playful twirl - costume melts away in flowing watercolor drips and reforms into Costume 4. Camera: slight zoom-in (1.0x to 1.2x) during this segment to emphasize energy. Each transformation accompanied by gentle "ding" sound effect and name tag appearing below character showing costume name in clean sans-serif font with drop shadow.

[四套服裝描述 with: "Christmas Set - Costume 1: REINDEER (brown onesie, yellow antlers, red collar with jingle bells), Costume 2: ELF (green tunic, pointed hat with bell, red-white striped tights), Costume 3: SNOWMAN (pure white body, yellow scarf, red mittens, ear tips white), Costume 4: CHRISTMAS TREE (green cone with ornaments, oversized gold star on head)" / "New Year Set - Costume 1: CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE (green glass body, gold foil wrapper, fizzy bubbles floating), Costume 2: PARTY POPPER (cone with confetti burst, metallic fringe), Costume 3: MIDNIGHT CLOCK (circular body with clock face showing 11:59, ornate hands), Costume 4: FIREWORK (body covered in sparkle trails, starburst effects)" / "Halloween Set - Costume 1: VAMPIRE (black cape with red lining, white fangs, slicked hair), Costume 2: WITCH (purple pointed hat, tiny broomstick, striped socks), Costume 3: GHOST (white flowing sheet, chain accessories, glowing eyes), Costume 4: JACK-O-LANTERN (round orange body, carved triangle eyes and smile, green stem hat)"]

**Climactic Freeze (3-4s):** Character in final Costume 4 strikes a dramatic "ta-da!" pose with arms spread wide (or up, depending on costume bulk). Camera: quick zoom-out (1.2x back to 1.0x) revealing full character and background. Particle effects intensify - gentle sparkles, floating thematic elements (snowflakes/confetti/autumn leaves) drift around character in slow-motion (0.5x speed). Small green text below character pulses: "(TAP & HOLD THE SCREEN)" mimicking social media filter UI. Soft motion blur on drifting particles. Character holds pose perfectly still for this 1 second, only eyes blink once at 3.5s mark. Background decorations (foliage, seasonal elements) remain static throughout.

**Ending Showcase (4-5s):** Character does one final small celebratory gesture (hop, wiggle, or peace sign depending on costume restrictions). All four costume name tags appear simultaneously in a grid layout at bottom 20% of screen, each showing the costume name with a tiny thumbnail icon. Watercolor vignette effect intensifies at edges (white to transparent gradient). Soft film grain overlay at 15% opacity for warmth. Color temperature maintains warm 5500K golden glow throughout. Final frame holds for 0.3s before fading to black with trailing sparkle particles. Overall mood: wholesome, energetic, designed to evoke "aww!" reactions and encourage social sharing.

**Technical Specifications:** 1080x1920 vertical format (9:16 aspect ratio for mobile), 60fps smooth animation with motion blur on rapid movements, 4K resolution (3840×2160), watercolor paper texture overlay at 15% opacity throughout, subtle film grain for analog warmth, color grading emphasizes pastel tones with selective bright accents on costume highlights.

**Camera Work:** 0-1s: Static frontal → 1-3s: Slow zoom-in (1.0x to 1.2x) with subtle handheld wobble for energy → 3-4s: Quick zoom-out back to 1.0x → 4-5s: Static hold. All movements smooth, no jarring cuts.

**Visual Effects:** Costume transformations use soft watercolor-style particle bursts (not harsh digital effects), gentle smoke puffs in pastel colors, sparkle overlays, motion blur trails during spins, floating seasonal elements (theme-appropriate), soft glow around character during transitions.

## Example

A dynamic 5-second costume transformation sequence filmed at 60fps in 4K resolution with explosive particle effects and rapid-fire costume changes, featuring Pikachu showcasing four festive outfits in rapid succession.

**Opening Frame (0-1s):** Soft watercolor-pastel illustration style background - grid paper texture in light blue (#E8F4F8) with faint 1cm squares. Christmas theme: Bottom shows soft snow bank with pinecones and holly, top has winter foliage and Poké Ball ornament. Pikachu appears in Costume 1 (REINDEER - brown onesie, yellow antlers, red collar with jingle bells), standing center frame in neutral pose. Hand-lettered orange text (#FF8C42) at top reads "CHOOSE YOUR FESTIVE PIKACHU!" with playful wobble effect. Camera: static frontal shot, Pikachu fills 60% of frame. Soft diffused lighting from top-left (45-degree angle). Gentle anticipation - Pikachu's eyes sparkle, slight breathing animation, ears twitch once.

**Rapid Transformation Sequence (1-3s):** EXPLOSIVE costume switching begins! At 1.0s mark, Pikachu spins 360 degrees at high speed (0.4 second spin) - during the spin blur, the REINDEER onesie vanishes in a burst of pastel-colored confetti particles (pinks, blues, creams) and Costume 2 (ELF - green tunic, pointed hat with bell, red-white striped tights) materializes with a soft "poof" of watercolor smoke effect. Pikachu lands in cheerful hands-on-hips pose. At 1.5s, Pikachu jumps upward - mid-air freeze frame (0.2s) with sparkle effects surrounding them, then drops down transformed into Costume 3 (SNOWMAN - pure white body, yellow scarf, red mittens, ear tips white) with a gentle bounce, small impact ripple in soft watercolor style spreads from feet. At 2.5s, Pikachu does a playful twirl - costume melts away in flowing watercolor drips and reforms into Costume 4 (CHRISTMAS TREE - green cone with ornaments, oversized gold star on head). Camera: slight zoom-in (1.0x to 1.2x) during this segment to emphasize energy. Each transformation accompanied by gentle "ding" sound effect and name tag appearing below Pikachu showing costume name in clean sans-serif font with drop shadow.

**Climactic Freeze (3-4s):** Pikachu in final CHRISTMAS TREE costume strikes a dramatic "ta-da!" pose with arms barely visible poking out from voluminous costume. Camera: quick zoom-out (1.2x back to 1.0x) revealing full Pikachu and background. Particle effects intensify - gentle sparkles, floating snowflakes drift around Pikachu in slow-motion (0.5x speed). Small green text below character pulses: "(TAP & HOLD THE SCREEN)" mimicking social media filter UI. Soft motion blur on drifting snowflakes. Pikachu holds pose perfectly still for this 1 second, only eyes blink once at 3.5s mark. Background decorations (snow bank, holly, Poké Ball) remain static throughout.

**Ending Showcase (4-5s):** Pikachu does one final small wiggle (limited by bulky tree costume). All four costume name tags appear simultaneously in a grid layout at bottom 20% of screen: "REINDEER | ELF | SNOWMAN | TREE" each with a tiny thumbnail icon. Watercolor vignette effect intensifies at edges (white to transparent gradient). Soft film grain overlay at 15% opacity for warmth. Color temperature maintains warm 5500K golden glow throughout. Final frame holds for 0.3s before fading to black with trailing sparkle particles. Overall mood: wholesome, energetic, designed to evoke "aww!" reactions and encourage social sharing.
