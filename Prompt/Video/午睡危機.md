## Prompt Template

A cinematic macro photography of **[在此填入角色名 / Kirby / 塵蟎 / 小倉鼠]** peacefully sleeping on a sun-warmed cotton blanket, curled into a soft ball, completely unaware of [迫近的威脅 with: 即將到來的災難 / "a massive vacuum cleaner nozzle slowly approaching from the background, creating subtle air currents" / "a giant hand descending from above, fingers creating dramatic shadows across the fabric landscape" / "a rolling wave of fabric being pulled away, like an approaching tsunami in slow motion"], bathed in warm golden-hour sunlight filtering through soft fabric fibers.

Split visual narrative combining peaceful foreground with ominous background. Foreground: Hyper-realistic macro photography aesthetic with extremely shallow depth of field (f/1.4) focused on the sleeping character, creating dreamy bokeh. Soft, diffused natural lighting with gentle rim light highlighting the character's contours. Warm color palette dominated by soft yellows, peachy oranges, and creamy whites. Visible texture details: fluffy cotton fibers, individual threads glowing in the backlight.

Background (slightly out of focus but recognizable): The approaching threat rendered with dramatic scale contrast, casting subtle shadows or creating gentle air disturbances. Dust particles caught in sunlight begin to swirl subtly, visual cue of impending change. Color temperature shifts slightly cooler in the background, creating atmospheric depth.

Composition: Medium close-up shot at eye level with the sleeping subject occupying the center-left third of the frame. The threat approaches from the upper-right background, creating diagonal tension. Subtle motion blur on background elements suggesting slow movement, while the character remains perfectly still and sharp. Gentle vignette focusing attention on the peaceful subject.

Technical execution: 8K resolution macro photography, focus stacking for critical sharpness on the character while maintaining cinematic bokeh. Subtle film grain texture (Kodak Portra 400 aesthetic) adding warmth and nostalgia. Volumetric lighting creating soft god rays through fiber gaps, with particles dancing in the light beams. Color temperature gradient: 3800K (warm) in foreground transitioning to 4500K (slightly cool) in background. Aspect ratio: 2.35:1 anamorphic for cinematic drama.

Emotional tone: Bittersweet tranquility meets impending disruption. The scene evokes the fleeting nature of peaceful moments—"the last moment of calm before the storm." Visual metaphor: life's unexpected interruptions intruding on our deserved rest. Combines cozy healing aesthetic with subtle disaster movie tension, creating memorable contrast without destroying the therapeutic atmosphere.

## Example

A cinematic macro photography of Kirby peacefully sleeping on a sun-warmed cotton blanket, curled into a soft ball, completely unaware of a massive vacuum cleaner nozzle slowly approaching from the background, creating subtle air currents, bathed in warm golden-hour sunlight filtering through soft fabric fibers.

Split visual narrative combining peaceful foreground with ominous background. Foreground: Hyper-realistic macro photography aesthetic with extremely shallow depth of field (f/1.4) focused on sleeping Kirby, creating dreamy bokeh. Soft, diffused natural lighting with gentle rim light highlighting Kirby's pink contours. Warm color palette dominated by soft yellows, peachy oranges, and creamy whites. Visible texture details: fluffy cotton fibers, individual threads glowing in the backlight.

Background (slightly out of focus but recognizable): The dark circular vacuum nozzle looms large, rendered with dramatic scale contrast, casting a subtle shadow across the cotton landscape. Dust particles caught in sunlight begin to swirl subtly toward the nozzle, visual cue of its suction power. Color temperature shifts slightly cooler near the nozzle, creating atmospheric depth and mild sense of unease.

Composition: Medium close-up shot at eye level with sleeping Kirby occupying the center-left third of the frame. The vacuum nozzle approaches from the upper-right background, creating diagonal tension across the frame. Subtle motion blur on swirling dust particles suggesting slow movement, while Kirby remains perfectly still and sharp. Gentle vignette focusing attention on the peaceful subject while maintaining awareness of the approaching threat.

Technical execution: 8K resolution macro photography, focus stacking for critical sharpness on Kirby while maintaining cinematic bokeh. Subtle film grain texture (Kodak Portra 400 aesthetic) adding warmth and nostalgia. Volumetric lighting creating soft god rays through fiber gaps, with dust particles dancing in the light beams. Color temperature gradient: 3800K (warm golden hour) around Kirby transitioning to 4500K (slightly cool neutral) near the vacuum. Aspect ratio: 2.35:1 anamorphic for cinematic drama.

Emotional tone: Bittersweet tranquility meets impending disruption. The scene evokes the fleeting nature of peaceful moments—Kirby享受著最後的寧靜午睡，渾然不知吸塵器正在逼近。Visual metaphor: life's unexpected interruptions (Monday alarm, chores, responsibilities) intruding on our deserved rest. Combines cozy healing aesthetic with subtle disaster movie tension, creating memorable contrast without destroying the therapeutic atmosphere.
