### 暗夜行者-中國古城飛簷走壁

深夜月色下，暗夜行者如鬼魅般在古城屋檐間無聲穿梭的5秒動作序列

---

## Prompt Template

A cinematic 5-second action sequence filmed at 60fps in 4K resolution with dynamic motion blur and atmospheric lighting.

**開場蓄勢 (0-1s):** Deep midnight hour, **[角色：暗夜行者 / 刺客 / 忍者 / 武林高手]** crouches low on the curved roof ridge of ancient Chinese architecture, body coiled like a panther ready to strike. Moonlight casts dramatic rim lighting on the silhouette. Cold desaturated blue-grey color palette dominates. [建築場景: "層層疊疊的青瓦飛檐，雕梁畫棟投下深邃陰影，薄霧在古巷中流動" / "宮殿式重檐建築群，琉璃瓦在月光下泛著幽光，遠處紅燈籠微明" / "江南水鄉古鎮，白牆黑瓦錯落，石橋拱起，水面倒影朦朧" / "北方城樓要塞，磚石城牆高聳，角樓飛簷層疊，旌旗獵獵"]. Mist drifts through the scene. Camera starts with a low-angle close-up, muscles tensed, eyes sharp and focused. Subtle ambient sound of distant night watchman's wooden clapper echoes.

**爆發突襲 (1-3s):** Explosive launch - figure bursts forward with inhuman speed and grace. Toes barely touch the glazed roof tiles, making zero sound. Body flows through a series of rapid parkour movements: running along narrow roof ridges, single-foot wall-run vertically up a 3-meter brick wall, 180-degree spin mid-air. Black flowing garments and sash flutter elegantly in the night wind like wings. Camera switches to fast tracking shot following the movement, mixed with slow-motion moments (240fps) highlighting the gravity-defying jumps. Volumetric god rays from the moon pierce through the mist. Architectural details blur past - ornate wooden brackets, carved stone dragons, ceramic roof guardians. Only the whisper-soft "whoosh" of fabric cutting through air.

**凌空飛躍 (3-4s):** The climactic moment - a massive 10-meter gap between two buildings looms ahead. Without hesitation, the shadow warrior takes three running steps and launches into a full-extension aerial leap across the dark void. Body stretches into a perfect horizontal line against the enormous full moon backdrop, arms reaching forward, legs extended back. Epic slow-motion (0.3x speed) with cinematic camera orbit rotating 120 degrees around the airborne figure. Black silhouette framed perfectly by the glowing moon disc and ancient city roofscape. Time seems frozen. Dramatic orchestral crescendo builds. Fine details captured: individual fabric threads rippling, tiny water droplets from mist refracting moonlight, determined expression visible through the face mask.

**完美落地 (4-5s):** Precision landing on the opposite building's flying eave corner - knees bend smoothly to absorb all impact energy, not a single roof tile shifts or makes sound. Figure holds the crouched position for 0.5 seconds like a statue, then rises fluidly. One final glance back toward camera with glowing eyes, then executes two quick wall-jumps ascending to the highest pagoda point. Silhouette stands dramatically on the ornate roof finial against the moon for a brief instant before dissolving into shadows with supernatural speed, vanishing completely into the layered maze of traditional rooftops. Camera pulls back to reveal the vast ancient cityscape at night - endless waves of curved roofs, mist rolling through valleys between buildings, moonlight painting everything in silver and deep blue. Only the sound of wind chimes tinkling and distant temple bell remains. Final frame fades to black with trailing wisps of mist.

**Technical Specs:** 4K resolution (3840×2160), 60fps base with slow-motion segments at 120-240fps, anamorphic 2.39:1 aspect ratio, film grain overlay for texture, desaturated color grading with selective warm glows from lanterns, volumetric fog and atmospheric haze, dynamic motion blur on fast movements, sharp focus on character with subtle background bokeh during aerial shots.

**Camera Work:** Low-angle establishing shot → Fast tracking/following cam → Orbital slow-motion → Wide pullback reveal. Handheld camera shake removed for smooth cinematic feel.

**Audio Design:** Minimal foley - fabric rustling, extremely subtle tile taps, wind ambience, distant night watch clapper, temple bell, wind chimes. Dramatic orchestral score builds from 1s to climax at 3.5s, then fades to ambient.
